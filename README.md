# Blade-Element-Theory
Computation of multirotor UAV rotor forces based on Blade Element Theory

A Matlab script to calculate the thrust and lateral forces (H-force and Y-force) generated by the rigid rotor systems typically used in multirotor UAVs. In this case, the script is filled with numbers characterizing the popular DJI 9450 plastic propeller, part of the DJI E310 propulsion system. The proposed model is based on a combination of Blade Element Theory and blade flapping theory models, the employed references are mentioned within the script.

The results from the proposed model were used for the project illustrated in the following paper:
